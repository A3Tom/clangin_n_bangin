# _Clang_-in n Bangin
This is a monorepo of mini-projects that I am writing using C.  

It's taken a couple decades but I've finally grown a pair and am ready to learn how to properly use a language that's had to be subject to the compiled nonsense I've spouted aw these years.  

## Ground Rules

### 1: AI Usage

> AI coding agents may not write or suggest any code in this repo.  
> Non-AI intellisense may be used within this repo.  
> LLMs may be used exclusively in a research capactity.  
> LLMs may be used to generate learning challenge spec sheets.  

The purpose of this is to keep ma brain from being turned to slop via overuse of AI coding agents so it'd be absolutley pointless if I were to use copilot or claude to write any code here.  
This isn't Anti-AI, it's a pro brain matter.
